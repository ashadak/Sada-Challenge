# sada-challenge

This repository consists of the solution to the Highest Profit problem from the collection of SADA challenges. The goal of this assessment is to read a CSV file containing corporate profits data, reproduce the data in JSON format, and look for the highest profit values in the data.

This problem is solved using various data manipulation techniques with mainly the use of functions provided in the Python Pandas library.

Note: This file requires Pandas, NumPy dependecies and was tested using a Bash terminal

In order to run this solution:
 - Dowload the zip file and extract its content.
 - Open up your terminal and navigate to the folder where the files are located. 
 - Run the command "run.sh" or "sh run.sh". This will result in the three outputs required for this challenge: The number of rows in the original data, the number of rows in the      data after dropping all rows with invalid non-numeric values in the profits column, and the top twenty rows with the highest profit values. In addition, a JSON file should be      generated in the current directory consisting of the updated data.
